# About {{ site.title }}

Engineering and doing research in fast networking environments can bring out
many interesting technical or conceptual elements. At one point I wanted to
share some of it, so here we are: this is my technical blog about my work at
[6WIND][].

Please note that this remains a personal blog: while my employer is fully aware
of its existence, the articles are not reviewed in details by 6WIND. This is
not even a roadmap blog. So opinions, points of view, technical mistakes and so
on are my own; experiments do not necessarily result in new functionalities for
the company's products; and **at no point should the responsibility of 6WIND be
engaged about something that is written here**. For your information, 6WIND
does have [an official blog](http://www.6wind.com/blog/), even though you may
find that it is more commercial than technical.

If you wish to react to something I wrote here, please feel free to send me an
email or to ping me on Twitter.

# About me

I am Quentin <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Monnet</span>, a French
R&D engineer. I joined 6WIND in fall 2015, after completing my PhD in computer
science.

I enjoy research, programming, open-source software, improving and sharing my
technical skills. There is a bit of all those things in my current position,
and in this blog I try to share the most interesting parts of it. You can find
more details about me on [my personal webpage](https://qmo.fr/).

# About 6WIND

[6WIND][] is a French medium company based close to Paris (with regional
offices on other continents). We specialize in producing and selling quality
software for high-speed packet processing in Linux environments. We work on
accelerating virtual networking infrastructure, and at the same time we try to
optimize hardware management on multicore architectures in order to provide
extremely high bit rates with a variety of network protocols, while saving as
much processing cores as possible for the software appliances. We go by one
motto: _Speed Matters_!

We also contribute to several open-source projects, including DPDK, the Linux
networking stack, OpenStack, Open vSwitch, Quagga and a few others.

We even have research activities, and take part in projects such as
[BEBA](http://www.beba-project.eu/our-team), with industrial but also academic
partners. As a side note, in my position I focus especially on such projects,
so they should motivate most of the articles of this blog.

More details are available on [the company's webpage][6WIND].

# Credits

This blog is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and is powered by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is Jekyll's default, slightly
modified, and with custom colors. The style in use for code blocks was inspired
by [Luna.vim](https://github.com/notpratheek/vim-luna) scheme. Some schemas
include icons derived from [an SVG
version](https://github.com/Xaviju/inkscape-open-symbols/tree/master/font-awesome)
of the [Font Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/).

If everything goes well, it should be displayed with [Fira
Sans](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/) fonts, designed by Mozilla (and Fira
Mono for code snippets).

The logo is based on a shot of a [male magnificent
frigate](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnificent-Frigate-male.jpg)
(“magnificent” is part of the name, actually) photographed by Wikimedia
Commons' user Benjamint444 and released under the terms of the [GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL)
1.2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/fdl-1.2.html) (and as a
consequence, so is the logo of this blog).
